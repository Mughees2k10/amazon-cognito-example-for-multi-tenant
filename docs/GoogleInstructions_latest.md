# **How to set up Google Workspace as a SAML identity provider with an Amazon Cognito user pool**

**Use these instructions to configure Google Workspace as a Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0) identity provider (IdP) with an** [**Amazon Cognito user pool.**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html)

Amazon Cognito user pools allow sign-in through third party IdPs such as Google Workspace. For more information, see [Adding user pool sign-in through a third party](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-federation.html) and [adding SAML identity providers to a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-saml-idp.html).

To set up Google Workspace as SAML IdP, you need an Amazon Cognito user pool and a Google Workspace account with an application.
